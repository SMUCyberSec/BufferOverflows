About: 
Welcome to TimeBreaker, the panic simulation game where you play a highschooler who just had a party and trashed his parents house! You had an awesome party while your parents were out of town, but you overslept and need to clean up before they get home. You just got a phone call that they are only 5 minutes away! 

Goal: 
You need to find a way to freeze time so you can clean the house before they arrive! You are given several options and then prompted for your decision. Enter your choice and hopefully you can stop time before your parents get home! Luckily I think there is a cheatcode function that will give you the magic powers to stop time. Good luck!
